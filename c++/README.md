## Here List some of the source that can compile with g++
Start from io (input and output)  
The sorts ways (by c++):

## SDL2
Under sdl2 folder, there would be some resources to show how to use 
SDL in some ways.  
The projects would be easy to complex.  
***The projects may use SDL2_mixer SDL2_image and SDL2_ttf these libs.***  
***Make sure you have already install them in your computer and can***
***right use the share libs.***  
Order:  
soundplay -> window -> scroller -> splayer  
### splayer
It would be the easy project to make a windows to control sound to play.  
It depends on *soundplay* and *scroller* in some ways.  

# Platforms
**All** the sources have only test under *Linux/Debian* system.  
They may *NOT* correctly run if compile in *windows* or *MacOS*.
